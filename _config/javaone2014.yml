      abstract: "Are you a Java developer and want to develop a mobile app that connects to a secured Java EE back end, but you don’t know where to start? This session is tailored for you. This live coding session, driven by Java and using a familiar development environment, goes step by step through building a complete mobile, hybrid, multiplatform application ready to be distributed on different vendors’ stores, such as the Apple store or Google Play. Starting from scratch, the tutorial takes you through building a simple Java EE application and, from there, scaffolding a mobile web client and turning it into a native app, including Android and iOS. This is an in-depth session in which the attendees will learn concretely, and without using hipster tools, how to enter the mobile world.\""

      abstract: "Over the last few years, we have seen the rise of NoSQL and big data. The CAP theorem is often cited as a reason for many of the architectural decisions used in the development of NoSQL, and one consequence is that most implementations do not support transactions. This lack of transactions offers benefits for some applications, but it has certain downsides, particularly in terms of fault tolerance and integrating with existing Java EE applications. As a result, the last year or so has seen many NoSQL implementations adopt transactions in one way or another. This session examines this trend back to adopting transactions, why it is happening, and what it means for the future."

This presentation starts with a brief look at NoSQL options and then takes a spatial REST service that uses JAX-RS and CDI and swaps out the data store underneath. The presenter uses MongoDB, Lucene Spatial, and PostGIS with Hibernate Spatial. Although he uses Java, these same kinds of tools can be used with many languages. You’ll see code and demos for each implementation and get some recommendations on how to select the right data store for your use case. By the end, you will see a full mapping application running with each of the data stores, using Java EE 6."

JVMs do better by using parallel (multiple threads working together) and concurrent (GC threads working while the mutator is running) techniques, but they can still cause unacceptably long pause times with today’s large heaps. This session discusses a new GC algorithm being developed at Red Hat for OpenJDK. Shenandoah is the first open source GC algorithm for OpenJDK that does marking and evacuation concurrently with running Java threads. Performing evacuation concurrently makes it possible to hit much stricter response time goals."

      abstract: "Write once, run anywhere has served us well over the years, but eventually everyone needs to use code that doesn’t run on the JVM. There are native libraries out there for crypto, graphics, data stores, computation, user interfaces, and much more, but they’ve been hard or impossible to use from JVM-based code. Until now. The Java Native Runtime (JNR) is a high-speed foreign function interface (FFI) for calling native code from Java without ever writing a line of C. Based on the success of JNR, JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) 191 will bring FFI to OpenJDK as an internal API. And hopefully a JSR for Java 9 will tightly integrate and standardize an FFI API. Learn more in this session. This talk will explore current and future FFI options, and show you how to help."

To ensure good code quality when building a new project or while migrating an existing project, it is crucial to have a solid test suite. This session covers how to take advantage of Oracle WebLogic Server 12c Maven support and how to define integration tests that will run against your Oracle WebLogic environment, taking full advantage of real Java Message Service (JMS) and JDBC resources and testing JavaServer Faces navigation and business objects. It also shows how you can configure this in your continuous integration environment."

      abstract: "Minecraft is a gaming sensation that has sold more than 14 million copies. It presents a blocky world in which you can rip down and build up as you see fit. Construct buildings, fight monsters, or dig expansive tunnels. A killer Minecraft feature is that you can run your own server and tweak the rules. The Java API for doing this is called Bukkit. Want your own teleportation system? Want to control the weather? Make the game behave the way you want it to. This session introduces a Ruby API on top of Bukkit called Purugin. The presentation weighs the merits of a statically typed language such as Java versus dynamically typed languages, discussing trade-offs in a fun format. Sit back and enjoy an entertaining talk on modding a fantastic game."

Devices had limited resources, user experience was not that good, and we didn’t even have 3G networks. The chances of having malware scanning a user’s device were unlikely. Today there are a myriad of platforms for mobile development, which means more options, more risks, and more confusion. Android, iOS, and hybrid applications can be powerful and flexible, but at the same time, they must be developed with security in mind. Learn more in this session."
