JavaScript API in Web browsers is also quite prevalent making it easier to support it.<br>Would you like to learn how to build WebSocket applications in Java ? How and where do you deploy these applications ? What are the concerns around firewall, DNS and routers ? How do you debug message exchanges ? What to do if WebSocket is not supported in the browser or app server ? Debugging and Production tips ? Learn about phantom WebSockets.<br>This university session is for you! Here is what we'll cover:<ul><li>Introduction to WebSocket</li><li>WebSocket using JSR 356</li><li>WebSocket using Undertow/WildFly</li><li>WebSocket using Atmosphere</li><li>Surviving Firewall and Proxy</li><li>WebSocket Debugging</li><li>WebSocket Production Tips</li></ul>"

  - title: Productive Java EE and HTML5 development with Eclipse
    abstract:  "During this session, we will show how developers can be productive when building Java EE 7 + HTML5 applications in Eclipse. We will see how the tooling in Eclipse helps us scaffolding from an existing database using JPA, then exposing the entities via JAX-RS and integrated Forge tooling. Some advanced features of JAX-RS 2.0 such as filters and support for bean validation that are recently added will also be shown. Finally the content will be shown in the browser using HTML5 + AngularJS. If time (and network) allows, the application will even be deployed on a PaaS, all without leaving the IDE.<br/>As any good, self-respecting 'Tools In Action' session, you should expect no slide, only coding and talking."

  - title: "OAuth2 for native apps"
    abstract: "Do you want to build a cool iOS/Android app to share your photos on Twitter, Facebook or Google+? If so, you will need to authenticate through OAuth2. Instead of using their own authentication schemes, most providers choose to implement OAuth2, the latest revision of the OAuth protocol. It gives users a secure way to talk to their services, but more importantly, allows users to safely authorise access to their data from third-party services without giving them their credentials.<br/>If you think security topic is hard to tackle, join me in this live coding session. We'll delve deep into OAuth2 protocol and see the challenges to overcome from a native app perspective: embedded web view vs external browser, URL schema for callback, local storage for tokens, refresh access tokens transparently...<br/>After this session, OAuth2 will have no secret to you!"

Those days, mobile is my playground, AeroGear my open source family. iOS is my platform by heart as my commits will tell."

    abstract: "A few years ago, I became a command line nuts. It came gradually. I started to add one, two command line tools. Then customise the shell here and there. Next thing you know, I barely used graphical UIs. And it felt good.<br/>I brought back balance to the force now and use the mouse here and there but I kept my useful command line tools and tricks and I am a better developer for it.<br/>Let me recount my journey and come learn useful tools, tips and workflow improvements for busy developers. Want samples: speed up pull request handling, share the same env across computers and servers, edit files and repeat modifications at the speed of light, define terminal tabs per work context...<br/>Some of the tools explored: #bash #rsync #git #tig #tmux #dotfiles #asciidoc #encfs #brew #mutt #weechat"

How can I as a beginner get started in a few hours?<br/>Whether your business is running on applications based on Java EE6, PHP or Ruby, the cloud is turning out to be the perfect environment for developing your business. There are plenty of clouds and platform-as-a-services to choose from, but where to start?<br/>Join us for three action-packed hours of power where we'll show you how to deploy your existing application written in the language of your choice - Java, Ruby, PHP, Perl or Python, with the project of your choice - jBPM, Ceylon, Switchyard, Drools Planner, Aerogear, GateIn, Drools (Rules / BPM) and more deployed into the OpenShift PaaS in just minutes.

This session takes three Java EE 7 applications running in production and shares lessons learned from each one. It attempts to answer questions such as Is WebSocket ready for production? How do we migrate from Spring Batch to JSR 352 batch? Any change in DevOps? Are additional libraries still needed? Which is more prominent, EJB/JSF or REST/JavaScript?"

    abstract: "IoT describes the ability to transfer data over the network with messaging without human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. To transfer the data, protocols such as MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) and AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) can be used. WebSockets can be used as a standardised way to communicate asynchronously between a web page and a server. The IoT protocols can be used to transfer data over WebSockets. The Machine to Machine (M2M) messages would be handled by a messaging and integration patterns server such as ActiveMQ.<br/>This session will provide an overview of messaging protocols like MQTT and AMQP and how these protocols can be used over WebSocket to transmit data. Design patterns and anti-patterns of different messaging protocols and architecture will be discussed in detail. The session will also show how these protocols were used in a real-life application with a Raspberry Pis cluster. Attendees will learn practical advise on how to configure Raspberry Pi and brokers for an optimised setting."
